# Personal Blockchain
I am creating this Blockchain to help me understand Blockchains on a more technical level. I only have an understanding from different articles and videos online. I hope to finish this project with a solid understanding of all the components of a Blockchain, and a deeper understanding of the technology behind emerging Cryptocurrencies. I also hope that this project can help understand Python much better as well.

Once the Blockchain has been completed, I plan to make it my own by adding unique aspects that I can hopefully figure out.
